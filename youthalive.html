                        YThe Mandate, NOW! John 2:3-5, 4:23
Many people face what can be called the "when-question" in the journey to fulfilling destiny, often believing that "the right time" for action has not yet arrived; even Jesus, as a young man, encountered the same challenge.
In John 2:4, Jesus said, …My time (hour to act) has not yet come. But His mother recognised His capacity – the gifts, talents, resources, He possessed. She observed a need and said to Him, …they have no wine (John 2:3b). Jesus’s response shows the human tendency to think, Is this really my responsibility? Are there not others with the same and even better abilities? After all, I haven’t received any specific call to act! Yet often, what we require to start is not more resources, rather, it’s just a decisive and some supportive push.
Just as Mary stimulated Jesus, many people may need the encouragement of someone who sees their potential, or the inner sense of dissatisfaction with the way things are around them – within their families, workplaces, communities, even up to the larger society. This restlessness can drive people to use their inner strengths to effect real change, bringing about the transformation they desire.
Consider that feeling as the first sign of your potential, much like the unrefined resources that signal wealth beneath earth’s surface, waiting to be tapped and refined. In the same manner that geologists identify and explore those resources, this Mandate is a tool to help us identify and explore our inborn gifts. It seeks to help us manifest our gifts and purpose in the present, affirming that the time for action is indeed NOW!
We invite all and sundry, young people (teenagers and youths) especially, to join wholeheartedly. Fasten your seat belt, as we sail towards transforming potentials into tangible and usable products.
May God guide and help us all as we embark and continue on this course. 
Welcome aboard, and may God bless you abundantly!

Your Brother,
Oladipo Adebayo Ebiesuwa
Convener
